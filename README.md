# Getx Flutter Package

GetX is an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter. It combines high-performance state management, intelligent dependency injection, and route management quickly and practically.

## ‚ö° Installation

To install getx Package, follow these steps

1. Add the package to your project's dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file:
   
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
      get: ^4.6.6
    ``` 
3. Run the following command to fetch the package:
    ``` 
    flutter pub get
    ``` 
## ‚ö° Usage

1. Add "Get" before your MaterialApp, turning it into GetMaterialApp:
   
    ```
   void main() => runApp(GetMaterialApp(home: Home()));
    ```
## ‚ö° Route management 

1. Navigate to a new screen::
   
    ```
   Get.to(NextScreen());
    ```   
2. To go to the next screen and no option to go back to the previous screen (for use in SplashScreens, login screens, etc.):
   
    ```
   Get.off(NextScreen());
    ```
3. To close snackbars, dialogs, bottomsheets, or anything you would normally close with Navigator.pop(context):
   
    ```
   Get.back();
    ```
 4. To go to the next screen and cancel all previous routes (useful in shopping carts, polls, and tests)
   
    ```
    Get.offAll(NextScreen());
    ```
 5. Navigate to new screen with name. See more details on named routes here

    ```
    Get.toNamed('/NextScreen');
    ```

## ‚ö° State management 

Get has two different state managers: the simple state manager (we'll call it GetBuilder) and the reactive state manager (GetX/Obx).

## üìç GetBuilder State management

1. create GetBuilderrController class extends GetxController:
 
    ```
   class GetBuilderCounterController extends GetxController {
     int counter=0;
     void increment(){
      counter++;
      update();
     }
   }
    
    ```
    upate() is required to change state
      
3. And in the UI, when you want to show that value and update the screen whenever the values changes, simply do this:
   
    ```
   GetBuilder<GetBuilderCounterController>(
    init: GetBuilderCounterController() ,
    builder: (controller){
        return Text("${controller.counter}"));
     }
    )

    ```
 ## üìç Obx State management
 
1. create ObxrController class extends GetxController:
 
    ```
   class ObxCounterController extends GetxController {
     RxInt counter=0.obs;
     void increment(){
      counter++;
     }
   }
    ```
      
3. And in the UI, when you want to show that value and update the screen whenever the values changes, simply do this:
   
    ```
    final ObxCounterController controller =Get.put(GetXAndObxCounterController());

    Obx(() => Text("${controller.counter.value}"));
    
    ```    
   
## üìç GetX State management

1. create GetXrController class extends GetxController:
 
    ```
   class GetXrController extends GetxController {
     RxInt counter=0.obs;
     void increment(){
      counter++;
     }
   }
    
    ```
     
3. And in the UI, when you want to show that value and update the screen whenever the values changes, simply do this:
   
    ```
   GetBuilder<GetXrController>(
    init: GetXrController() ,
    builder: (controller){
        return Text("${controller.counter.value}"));
     }
    )

    ```
## ‚ö° Dependency management 

Get has a simple and powerful dependency manager that allows you to retrieve the same class as your Bloc or Controller with just 1 lines of code, no Provider context, no inheritedWidget:
 ```
Controller controller = Get.put(Controller()); // Rather Controller controller = Controller();
 ```
## ‚ö° Bindings
Bindings are classes where we can declare our dependencies and then ‚Äòbind‚Äô them to the routes. However, this means that we can only use it when using GetX for route management.

1. start by creating a class that implements Bindings class.

 ```
 class HomeBinding implements Bindings {}
 ```

2. need to override the dependencies() method, where we‚Äôll insert all our dependencies.

 ```
class HomeBinding implements Bindings {
  @override
  void dependencies() {
    Get.put<Controller1>(Controller1());
    Get.put<Controller2>(Controller2());
  }
}

 ```

3. we can ‚Äòbind‚Äô these dependencies to our routes.
 ```
 GetMaterialApp( // remember this?
  initialRoute: "/",
  getPages: [
    GetPage(name: "/", page: () => HomePage(), binding: HomeBinding()), // here!
  ],
 );
 
 Get.to(HomePage(), binding: HomeBinding()); // or like this!
 Get.toNamed("/", binding: HomeBinding()); // and this!
 ```
We can also set a Binding to create the dependencies as soon as the app starts, by declaring it as initialBinding.
 ```
GetMaterialApp(
  initialRoute: "/",
  initialBinding: HomeBinding(), // here!
);
```

GetX also provides BindingsBuilder that lets us use bindings without creating a separate class.
 ```
GetMaterialApp(
  initialRoute: "/",
  initialBinding: BindingsBuilder(() { // like this!
    Get.put(Controller());
  }),
);
 ```

4. to use access the dependencies, we can simply use Get.find.
 ```
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {

  Controller controller = Get.find(); // it'll work!

}
 ```
